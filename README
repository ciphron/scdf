Simple Circuit Description Framework

This code provides support for writing circuits in python that use AND and XOR (or multiplication or additiion in some ring). This is suited to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We intend to add bindings for HElib to allow evaluation with an FHE scheme. We include alggorithms to reduce the depth of a circuit, expand a circuit, simplify a circuit and to remove duplicate gates. Some examaple circuits are provided including two algorithms to compute the hamming weight along with their supporting circuits. In addition, an implementation of the direct sort algorithm from https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/274.pdf is included along with an optimized version that avails of SIMD operations. The file sort.py includes a sorting network sort in addition to direct sort and its SIMD-optimized counterpart. The file test_sort.py sets up the framework to sort an array of 8 elements using the SIMD-optimized version of direct sort and computes its reduced depth. Furthermore, test_hamming.py sets up the framework to compute the hamming weight of an array. This should illustrate how to use the framework.
